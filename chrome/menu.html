     <p id="running"><strong>Working</strong>: If you see a pink cupcake, your proxy is running.</p>
     <p id="darkblue"><img src="images/cupcake36.png"> A plain pink cupcake means the proxy is running but no one is using it right now.</p>
     <p id="lightblue"><img src="images/active_icon.png"> A happy cupcake means someone is using your proxy right now. Neat!</p>
<hr>
     <p id="notworking"><strong>Not working:</strong> In some cases, Cupcake may temporarily disable itself. Usually this is due to internet connection problems or firewall settings.</p>
     <p id="grey"><img src="images/grey_icon.png"> A sad grey cupcake means that the badge has disabled itself. You may be behind a firewall that is blocking outgoing connections temporarily (such as at a cafe). Cupcake will automatically reconnect. </p>
